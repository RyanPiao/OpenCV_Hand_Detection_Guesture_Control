# Open**H**aptic**E**ngine
This repo is a test for my OpenHE Project, OpenHE is a universal haptic feedback solution for VR Games. This program is able to recognizeÂ the human hand by utilizing OpenCV and mediapipe, using the captured hand data to track position of fingers in real-time, and using hand gestures to control the system volume. This will be part codes of my main project Open**H**aptic**E**ngine.

**When index finger and thumb are fully apart from each other: Max windows volume**

**When index finger and thumb are fully touch each other: Min window volume**
