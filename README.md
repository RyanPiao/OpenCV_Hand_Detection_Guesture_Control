# OpenCV_Hand_Detection_Guesture_Control
Test for my OpenHE Project, OpenHE is a universal haptic feedback solution for VR Games. This program is able to reconize human hand by utilize opencv and mediapipe, use the captured hand data to track postion of fingers in real time, and use hand guesture to control system volumn. This will be part of my main project OpenHapticEngine.

**When index finger and thumb are fully apart from each other: Max windows volumn**

**When index finger and thumb are fully touch each other: Min window volumn**
